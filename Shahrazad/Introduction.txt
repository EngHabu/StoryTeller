Scheherazade is a legendary Persian queen and the storyteller of One Thousand and One Nights.
The story goes that every day Shahryar (the king) would marry a new virgin, and after doing so would despatch the previous day's wife to be beheaded. This was done in anger, having found out that his first wife was unfaithful to him. 
He had killed 1,000 such women by the time he was introduced to Scheherazade, the vizier's daughter.
