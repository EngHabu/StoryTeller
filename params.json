However it's built with other media types in mind, example: videos.\r\n\r\n**Hadoota** provides the author with means to create multiple versions of the same story, and adding meta-data to the story to give each reader a unique experience.\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n- Storylines to build a story with multiple paths/ends\r\n- Re-order scenes in a storyline\r\n- Preview panel to read the story as it's being authored\r\n- Read story in Full Screen view mode (Reader's mode)\r\n- Build link in text, to link one scene to another\r\n- Tag each scene with interesting features, example: character, place, date, etc...\r\n- Mark bonus scenes. Those scenes appear based on reader's preferences\r\n- Enable reader to pick their favorite tags (characters, places, etc...) to unveil \"bonus\" scenes\r\n- Import library of text content\r\n- Edit library content in application\r\n\r\n**Why Hadoota?**\r\n- Easy re-ordering of story content in the storyline, with real-time preview.

Every reader gets to pick the story path, or simply can go with the default path.\r\n\r\nList of future work includes, but not limited to: Invest in smart tagging (suggest tags automatically to the author) and components that enable the author to produce a good story.
