A rustling sound outside the window startled them awake. "Sounds like a bird of some kind," Rhonda commented.
"Pretty big bird," said Melissa. The rustling sound was more like the beating of giant wings. Both girls ran to the window. "Can't see anything. Can you?" Melissa asked. "No, but let's go outside for a closer look," was Rhonda's idea.
They both hurried to the front door, skipped down the steps, and stealthily turned the corner along the right side of the house. Fat snowflakes caught in their hair and eyelashes. The snow was really beginning to come down as they crept along until they got to the dining room window. The air was totally silent. Nothing. Disappointed, they trooped back into the house.
The house itself was very quiet, only a faint hissing of logs on the fire could be heard. They walked back to the Christmas tree, practically on the tips of their toes so as not to break the peacefulness of their surroundings. Their eyes were drawn to the glowing angel on top of the tree.
They watched as a shower of snow fell from her wings and melted onto the floor below.
