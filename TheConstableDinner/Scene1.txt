Rhonda, filled with excitement, hung up the phone. "Mother!" she called out, "I've been invited to Melissa's for dinner tonight. What should I wear?"
Her mother came into Rhonda's bedroom. "Well, isn't that nice! You'll have a wonderful time, {Scene2:I know. Now, the important thing is to find a suitable dress}. The Constables are very formal. You'll eat in the main dining room of course, and you'll have servants waiting on you. How lucky it is, that you have such a grand friend in Melissa. You get to see life as it is lived by the rich and famous. But, now, about the dress."
Rhonda and her mother stood in front of the wardrobe. "It's a good thing we went shopping for Christmas outfits last week," said Mrs. Wilson. "How about this?" She held out a midnight blue sequined dress for Rhonda's approval. "Maybe too dressy?" Rhonda asked. "Well, then, this might be just the thing," said her mother, taking out a long wine-coloured taffeta skirt, shot through with black highlights. "You could pair it with the black knitted top we bought, and wear those nice new cultured pearl earrings. As for shoes, the new black velvet pumps are a treat, don't you think?"
"Perfect!" exclaimed Rhonda. Wardrobe decided, {Scene3:she rushed into the bathroom}, and turned on the taps. "Lots of bubbles, that's what I want!"
